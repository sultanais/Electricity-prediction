# Electricity-prediction
In this project I predict electricity consumption of one building.
The dataset is taken from Building Data Genome 2 project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/claytonmiller/buildingdatagenomeproject2  
I performed data preprocessing, feature engineering and exploratory data analysis.
Finally, I build several models (Linear regression, KNN regression, Random Forestregression, XGBoost regression). Then, I enhanced them via hyperparameters tunning and feature selection
